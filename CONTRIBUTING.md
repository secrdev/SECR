# Contributing to SECR 

## Issues

### Issues can either be:

- Bug reports
- Feature requests

You can contribute them by going to the `Issues` tab in the repository, then filling out their respective templates accordingly.

## Code

For the next couple of months, SECR will remain unstable, and as such, will not have any official releases.

### You can contribute code like so:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch for the issue you want to address using the following syntax:
   - `<feature-name>-<issue-number>`
3. Open a pull request against master.
4. If it either fixes a bug, or implements a new feature properly, it will be approved and merged.
